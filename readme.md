# Mod Settings

## Installation

[Get the latest release here](https://github.com/jackhumbert/mod_settings/releases) - `packed-v*.zip` in the release contains all of the requirements listed below at their most up-to-date versions (at the time of release). Simply extract it and copy the contents in your game's installation folder.

If you want to install the mod outside of a release (not recommended), the `build/` folder in the repo contains all of the mod-specific files that you can drag into your game's installation folder.

## Configuration

Configuration is done through redscript classes. [See one example here](https://github.com/jackhumbert/in_world_navigation/blob/main/src/redscript/in_world_navigation/InWorldNavigation.reds). Variable & class names are limited to 1024 characters.

## Requirements

* [RED4ext](https://github.com/WopsS/RED4ext)
* [Redscript](https://github.com/jac3km4/redscript)

## Bugs

If you come across something that doesn't work quite right, or interferes with another mod, [search for or create an issue!](https://github.com/jackhumbert/mod_settings/issues) I have a lot of things on a private TODO list still, but can start to move things to Github issues.
